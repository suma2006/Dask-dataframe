# Dask DataFrame

## Introduction
Dask dataframe is an extension of pandas which deals with the datasets that are too large to fit into memory. Partitioning these into smaller chunks allows Dask to perform scalable and efficient large-scale data processing using parallel computing.

## Installation and settings
Install Dask using below command
```py
pip install dask[complete]
```

To install Dask using Conda

```py
conda install -c conda-forge dask
```

To check the version
```py
import dask
print(dask._version_)
```

## Key Features and Explanation

A Parallel Computing Library for Large Datasets Dask DataFrame fully extends Pandas to skillfully manage substantially large datasets, through parallel and distributed computing. It works well for big data analytics because it scales easily. Here are its key features:

### Parallel Computing for Faster Performance

Dask splits data into smaller parts, processing them in parallel across many CPU cores. It can also powerfully scale the distributed clusters in situations where workloads are substantially larger.

### Handles Datasets Larger Than RAM

Dask processes each bit of data in multiple chunks, enabling it to work with many terabyte-scale datasets, whereas Pandas loads each bit into memory.

### Supports Multiple File Formats

It can read and write data from CSV, Parquet, and SQL databases. It also works with AWS S3, GCP, and Azure cloud storage.

### Lazy Execution for Efficiency

Dask optimizes memory use and speed by delaying all computations until the .compute()command is called.

### Task Scheduling & Monitoring

It offers a task scheduler that is complete and optimized, along with real-time visual dashboards made for full performance monitoring.

### Integrates with Machine Learning & Big Data

It works with Scikit-learn, XGBoost, CuDF (GPU acceleration), and Spark for advanced analytics.

# Code Examples

## Load the Data and Check Basic Info
```py
import dask.dataframe as dd
# this imports the Dask DataFrame module
file_path = '1000000_Sales_Records.csv' 
df = dd.read_csv(file_path)
# dd.read_csv(file_path) reads the CSV file lazily
print(df.dtypes) 
# loads the entire dataset into memory immediately.
print(df.shape)
#only loads the necessary parts on demand.
```

```py

```

## Descriptive Statistics

```py
desc_stats = df.describe().compute()
#Computes summary statistics (like mean, max, min, etc.) for numeric columns and converts the lazy Dask computation into an actual Pandas DataFrame.
print(desc_stats)
# prints the result.
print("Total Revenue Sum:", df['Total Revenue'].sum().compute())
# Computes the total sum of the "Total Revenue" column and prints the total revenue.
print("Max Profit:", df['Total Profit'].max().compute())
# Finds the maximum value in the "Total Profit" column, Executes and retrieves the highest profit value.
print("Mean Units Sold:", df['Units Sold'].mean().compute())
# Computes the average (mean) number of units sold and Executes the operation and prints the final numeric value.
```

```py

```

## Sorting data
```py
sorted_df = df.compute().sort_values('Total Profit', ascending=False)
# Sorts the DataFrame by "Total Profit" in descending order (highest profit first)
print(sorted_df.head())
# Prints the first 5 rows of the sorted DataFrame.
```

## Handeling Missing data
```py
df_cleaned = df.dropna()
# Compute the result (Dask is lazy, so you need to call compute to get the actual DataFrame)
df_cleaned_computed = df_cleaned.compute()
# Show the cleaned data
print(df_cleaned_computed)
```

## Aggregation and grouping
```py
df_grouped=df.groupby('Item Type',observed=True)['Total Profit']
# Groups the DataFrame based on unique values 
print('Multiple aggregations:')
display(df_grouped.agg(['count','sum','mean','std']))
# Applies multiple aggregations (count, sum, mean, std) on "Total Profit" and displays the results.
```
```py

```
## Use cases

### Handling large data:

If data is too large, Dask helps to break data into small parts and manage them efficiently.

### Faster data analysis: 

Dask can run multiple tasks at once, accelerating the data analysis process.

### Machine learning on large data:

Dask is used to clean and preprocess big data prior to applying it to train machine learning models.

### Real time data processing:

Dask ensures data processing is smooth and efficient when dealing with large databases and files.

### Optimizing Data Workflows:

Dask handles live data, such as prices of stocks or sensor data, efficiently and rapidly.so that we utilize Dask.

## Conclusion

Dask DataFrame is a powerful tool for efficient handling of large datasets. It is an extension of Pandas that allows parallel and distributed computing, enabling you to process terabyte-scale data without overloading memory. It supports several file formats, integrates with big data & machine learning tools, and offers real-time monitoring for optimal performance. Final Thought: When you're dealing with large-scale data processing Dask is a scalable, efficient, and easy-to-use tool that accelerates computations while saving memory.
